The planet you are about to visit, Elon, is deadly to all its habitants. The atmosphere is full of a odor- and colorless gas toxic to most humanoid species. In fact, 1 week spent in such harsh conditions will significantly ruin your health (-1 HP each week).

You will need to build a special device, tailored to your species, which will help you survive on Elon. You have been provided with plans from the Elonians, and it turns out that some of the crystal found by explorers on planet Null allows for the creation of this device - in its pulverized form, when inhaled in tiny concentrations, it reacts with the gas molecules and neutralizes then. It will allow you to survive the inhuman conditions of this planet. 

There is a catch, however. The plans for the device derive from the Elonian physiology, which is enhanced with nanites and thus provides an easy interface to harvest the body's neural electricity to trigger the chemical reactions necessary to make the crystal reactive to the gas.

Species without this adaptation will have to place it over the heart, where two microscopic electrodes will connect to the heart's nerves and get the power from there, as the reactions have to be synced to the recipient's body. The high concentration of gas in the atmosphere, however, will require that the whole process work faster than the resting heart rate, so an elevated heart rate for a prolonged period will be required to harness the device's full benefits.

Heroes, Explorers ... Makers! We need your help!

Your role is to build The Device to help everyone survive on planet Elon during upcoming fit-quest. There is no time to spare so get to work right away.

Rules in here are simple. You need to implement application that integrates with #fit-quest Slack channel.

Each time someone completes a challenge, application should pick it up and try to convert it into HP.

Our faith lies in your hands. Hurry up!
